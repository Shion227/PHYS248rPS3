    "Generally speaking, the total number of the particles created by those particles entering the detector were very large.\n",
    "Similarities between the behaviours of thsoe three particles can be reasoned that they are all creating a hadronic shower.\n",
    "However, the average energy deposition tends to be slightly higher for Pi+ compared to proton and neutron. This can be explained by the fact that Pi+ is a charged particle, and it also looses energy through electronic energy loss in addition to the hadronic shower. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pi0 at 20 GeV (average deposition: around 20 GeV)\n",
    "The clustering was much smaller than Proton or Pi+, and looked very smilar to photon and electron cases in terms of the shape.\n",
    "This can be explained because pi0 mainly decays into photon pairs or electron pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mu- at 20 GeV (average deposition: around 2 GeV)\n",
    "Muon almost passes through the detector without much interaction. Since muon is much heavier than electron, it emits less bremsstrahlung energy, and deposits less energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tau- at 20 geV (average deposition: ranging from 2 GeV to 20 GeV)\n",
    "This seemingly random patter of the energy deposition can be explained by what tau- decays into. Tau- can decay into lighter leptons. When tau deays into electron, we see energies deposited into the material and similar behaviour to part a) and b). However, when it decays into mu-, since mu- does not deposit any energy into the material, the energy average deposition can be as low as what we saw for the mu- case. \n"
